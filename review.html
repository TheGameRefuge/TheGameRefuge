			I honestly thought this game was going to be stupid. And quite frankly, it was. <br>
			But it was stupid in a good stupid kind of way. You know the one I mean? It’s just like that one friend we all have, that has idiotic ideas,<br>
			which get everyone in trouble and wastes your time when you should be studying, but ultimately you have tons of fun and have a smile on your face for the rest of the day. <br>
			Ragdoll mode is my personally favorite. <br>
			<br>
			I would rate this game a solid 5/10 for graphics, 2/10 for story and 8/10 for enjoyment.</p> <a href="simulators.html"> More on simulators </a>

			<p class="blk">So you may have noticed that lately this game has consumed my life. <br> 
			I love it, the toxic f**ks that ruin my day in competitive, the throwers that knock my rank down to a bare minimum, <br>
			the sexists that tell me to get my a** back in the kitchen. But that’s only the community. Only being a huge understatement since in <br>
			this game that’s all you can play with. And another thing about the people in this game, they are the most cut-throat pieces sh*t. <br>
			That’s coming from a person who has 600 hours on CS:GO. I didn’t really feel like rank and competitive matters before I played this game. <br>
			But now, oh now, I will track down the next b***ard that dares to go f**king symmetra one more time. <br>
			I would rate this game 8/10 for graphics and visual effect, 0/Jeff Kaplan for community and Uninstall/10 for enjoyment. <br>

			(the cursing is all for good fun, chill guys)
