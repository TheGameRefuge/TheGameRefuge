	A simulation video game describes a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate real world activities.<br>

	A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training, analysis, or prediction.<br>
	Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, with players instead allowed to freely control a character.<br>
	Well-known examples are war games, business games, and role play simulation.<br>

	From three basic types of strategic, planning, and learning exercises: games, simulations, and case studies, a number of hybrids may be considered, including simulation games that are used as case studies.<br>

	Comparisons of the merits of simulation games versus other teaching techniques have been carried out by many researchers and a number of comprehensive reviews have been published.
